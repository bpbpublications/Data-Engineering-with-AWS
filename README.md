## About the Book
Data engineering and AWS form the backbone of modern enterprise data architecture, enabling organizations to harness the exponential growth of data for competitive advantage. As businesses generate petabytes of information daily, the ability to build scalable, secure, and cost-effective data platforms has become critical for survival in today's data-driven economy.

This comprehensive guide takes you through the complete journey of building enterprise-grade data platforms on AWS. You will understand data lake foundations with S3, implement real-time streaming with Kinesis, and optimize batch processing using Glue. The book covers advanced topics, including data warehouse engineering with Redshift, modern architectural patterns like data mesh, and cross-boundary data sharing strategies. The guide explores the GenAI revolution transforming data platforms from human-centric to AI-native systems, covering enhanced medallion architectures that serve both traditional analytics and generative AI workloads. 

By the end of this book, you will be able to design and build scalable, secure, and cost-effective data platforms on AWS. You will master the skills to process massive datasets, implement enterprise-grade security, and architect solutions for real-time analytics and ML workflows, ultimately driving significant business value.
